# Homebrew formula for XBoing (macOS / Linux brew).
#
# Build + install only.  The brew install provides the game and the
# per-user (personal) high-score table, which the game writes under the
# user's XDG data dir at runtime — no install-time provisioning needed.
#
# There is intentionally NO shared/global leaderboard on this channel:
# the cross-user "machine" board ships only via the Debian .deb (setgid
# games + /var/games), and cross-machine standings are a future API
# leaderboard.  Homebrew sandboxes post_install and cannot provision
# shared state outside its prefix anyway.
